# Plan Sync

## Overview

End-to-end planning skill: convert PRD/spec/roadmap inputs into schema-aligned `.plans` JSON files, validate integrity, then sync epics/stories/tasks to GitHub Issues and Projects v2 with idempotent reruns.

Supports three modes: `plan` (generate only), `sync` (sync existing plans), `full` (generate + sync).

## Skill Invocation Gate (MANDATORY)

Before any action, list available skills and invoke all that apply. If installed and applicable, you MUST use them. Process skills take priority over implementation skills.

## Prerequisites

- `planpilot` CLI installed and on PATH (see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/aryeko/planpilot/blob/main/src/planpilot/skills/INSTALL.md))
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (scopes: `repo`, `project`)

## When to Use

- User asks to turn PRD/spec/roadmap docs into `.plans` JSON artifacts
- User asks to break specs into epics, stories, tasks
- User asks to push epics/stories/tasks into GitHub Issues + Projects v2
- User asks for one-command planning + project sync workflow
- User has multiple overlapping specs and needs one merged executable plan

Do **not** use when the user is asking to implement roadmap tasks.

## Inputs

Required for `plan` mode:
- One or more PRD/spec/roadmap files to decompose

Required for `sync` mode:
- `repo` (`OWNER/REPO`)
- `project_url` (GitHub Projects v2 URL)
- Existing `.plans/*.json` files

Required for `full` mode:
- All of the above

Recommended defaults:
- `plans_dir = .plans`
- `sync_path = .plans/sync-map.json`
- `label = planpilot`
- `status = Backlog`
- `priority = P1`
- `iteration = active`
- `size_field = Size`
- `size_from_tshirt = true`

## Outputs

Planning artifacts:
- `.plans/epics.json`
- `.plans/stories.json`
- `.plans/tasks.json`
- `planpilot.json`

Sync artifacts:
- `<sync_path>.dry-run` (dry-run sync map)
- `<sync_path>` (apply sync map)

## Item Scoping Rules

### Hierarchy Definitions

| Level | What it represents | Sizing guidance |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Epic** | Strategic outcome or major capability. Maps to a project milestone or theme. | Multiple sprints / weeks of work. |
| **Story** | A single PR-sized deliverable that ships user-visible or system-visible value. | 1–3 days of focused work. If larger, split into multiple stories. |
| **Task** | A concrete, executable unit of work within a story. One developer, one sitting. | Hours, not days. |

### Decomposition Checklist

When analyzing specs, apply these rules:

1. **Epics** — extract from strategic outcomes, high-level features, or capability areas. Each epic should be independently valuable.
2. **Stories** — break each epic into PR-sized deliverables. Each story must:
   - Be implementable in a single PR
   - Have clear acceptance criteria that can be verified
   - Deliver testable, reviewable value
3. **Tasks** — break each story into executable steps. Each task must:
   - Be completable by one developer in one sitting
   - Have concrete requirements (not vague goals)
   - Include verification commands or evidence where possible

### Scoping Fields

Use `scope` to define explicit boundaries for any item:

```json
{
  "scope": {
    "in_scope": ["Build REST endpoint for /api/register", "Input validation"],
    "out_scope": ["OAuth integration", "Password reset flow"]
  }
}
```

### Sizing with Estimates

Use `estimate` on stories and tasks to communicate expected effort:

```json
{ "estimate": { "tshirt": "S" } }
{ "estimate": { "tshirt": "M", "hours": 8 } }
{ "estimate": { "hours": 4 } }
```

Valid t-shirt sizes: `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`. When `size_from_tshirt` is enabled in config, the t-shirt value maps to the project board's Size field.

### Conflict Resolution (Multi-Spec)

When merging multiple specs:
- Stricter acceptance criteria wins
- If equally strict, newer spec wording wins
- Record assumptions in the item's `assumptions` field

---

## Plan JSON Schema

### Item Types

Every item **must** include a `type` field: `"EPIC"`, `"STORY"`, or `"TASK"`.

### Required Fields (All Types)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Globally unique across all plan files |
| `type` | `string` | `"EPIC"`, `"STORY"`, or `"TASK"` |
| `title` | `string` | Short descriptive title |
| `goal` | `string` | What this item aims to achieve |
| `requirements` | `string[]` | Non-empty list of concrete requirements |
| `acceptance_criteria` | `string[]` | Non-empty list of verifiable criteria |

### Hierarchy Fields

| Field | Type | Rules |
|-------|------|-------|
| `parent_id` | `string \| null` | **Epics**: must be `null` or omitted. **Stories**: must reference an Epic `id`. **Tasks**: must reference a Story `id`. |
| `sub_item_ids` | `string[]` | Optional. List of child item IDs (informational; engine derives children from `parent_id`). |
| `depends_on` | `string[]` | Optional. IDs of items that must complete before this one. Cross-type allowed. |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `motivation` | `string` | Why this item matters |
| `estimate` | `object` | `{"tshirt": "S"}` and/or `{"hours": 6}` |
| `scope` | `object` | `{"in_scope": [...], "out_scope": [...]}` |
| `verification` | `object` | `{"commands": [], "ci_checks": [], "evidence": [], "manual_steps": []}` |
| `spec_ref` | `object` | `{"url": "...", "section": "...", "quote": "..."}` (`url` required if present) |
| `success_metrics` | `string[]` | Measurable outcomes |
| `assumptions` | `string[]` | Assumptions made during decomposition |
| `risks` | `string[]` | Known risks or blockers |

### JSON Rules

- No comments
- No trailing commas
- Strict JSON only

### Plan File Layouts

**Split layout** (recommended): three separate arrays

```
.plans/epics.json    →  [ { Epic }, ... ]
.plans/stories.json  →  [ { Story }, ... ]
.plans/tasks.json    →  [ { Task }, ... ]
```

**Unified layout**: single file with typed items

```
.plans/plan.json  →  { "items": [ { Epic }, { Story }, { Task }, ... ] }
```

### `planpilot init`

Interactive config generator:

```bash
planpilot init
planpilot init --output ./planpilot.json --defaults
```

Flags:
- `--output` / `-o` (default: `planpilot.json`): output path
- `--defaults`: skip prompts, use defaults

### `planpilot sync`

Sync plan files to GitHub:

```bash
planpilot sync --config ./planpilot.json --dry-run
planpilot sync --config ./planpilot.json --apply
planpilot sync --config ./planpilot.json --apply --verbose
```

Flags:
- `--config <path>`: required, path to planpilot.json
- `--dry-run` or `--apply`: required, mutually exclusive
- `--verbose` / `-v`: enable debug logging

### `planpilot --version`

Print installed version.

## Workflow

### 1) Mode Select

If mode is not explicit, ask once:
1. **Plan only** — generate/validate JSON from specs
2. **Sync only** — sync existing `.plans` files to GitHub
3. **Full** — generate + sync

Default recommendation: **Full**.

### 2) Analyze Specs (plan / full)

1. Read all PRD/spec/roadmap files
2. Extract: outcomes, requirements, constraints, dependencies, acceptance criteria
3. Resolve conflicts across specs (see Conflict Resolution above)
4. Record assumptions in item `assumptions` fields

### 3) Decompose into Plan Items (plan / full)

1. Identify **Epics** from strategic outcomes and major capabilities
2. Break epics into **Stories** — each must be PR-sized (1–3 days)
3. Break stories into **Tasks** — each must be one-sitting executable work
4. Wire hierarchy: set `parent_id` on every story and task
5. Set `depends_on` where sequencing is required
6. Add `estimate`, `scope`, `verification`, `spec_ref` where applicable
7. Write `.plans/epics.json`, `.plans/stories.json`, `.plans/tasks.json`

### 4) Validate (plan / full)

Syntax validation:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool .plans/epics.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool .plans/stories.json >/dev/null
python3 -m json.tool .plans/tasks.json >/dev/null
```

Integrity checks:
- All `id` values globally unique across all plan files
- Every item has `type`, `title`, `goal`, `requirements`, `acceptance_criteria`
- All `parent_id` references exist and type-match (Story → Epic, Task → Story)
- All `depends_on` references exist
- Epics have no `parent_id`
- No circular dependencies

### 5) Preflight (sync / full)

Run preflight **before** config check — you need a working `planpilot` to run `planpilot init`.

#### 5a) Verify planpilot is available

```bash
planpilot --version
```

If this fails, STOP and direct the user to install planpilot — see https://github.com/aryeko/planpilot/blob/main/src/planpilot/skills/INSTALL.md.

#### 5b) Verify GitHub auth

```bash
gh auth status
```

If auth fails, STOP and request login.

### 6) Ensure Config Exists (sync / full)

Check for `planpilot.json` in the working directory.

**If config is NOT found**, prompt the user:

> `planpilot.json` not found. Would you like to generate one?

If the user agrees, run the interactive init wizard. **You MUST run this from the git repository root** so that auto-discovery works:

- `detect_target()` reads the `origin` remote URL to pre-fill `OWNER/REPO` — this only works inside a git repo.
- `detect_plan_paths()` scans `.plans/` and `plans/` for existing plan files to pre-fill paths.
- Outside a git repo, both detections are disabled and every value must be entered manually.

```bash
cd <repo-root>
planpilot init
```

The wizard asks these questions in order. Forward each to the user with the hints below:

| # | Question | Hint for user |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Provider** | Currently only `github` is supported. Accept default. |
| 2 | **Target repository (owner/repo)** | Auto-detected from git remote if inside a repo. Verify it matches the intended target. |
| 3 | **Board URL** | The GitHub Projects v2 URL, e.g. `https://github.com/orgs/OWNER/projects/N`. Find this on the project board page. The org is pre-filled from the target. |
| 4 | **Plan file layout** | `Split` (separate epics/stories/tasks files — recommended) or `Unified` (single plan.json). |
| 5 | **Plan file paths** | Auto-detected if `.plans/` already has files. Defaults: `.plans/epics.json`, `.plans/stories.json`, `.plans/tasks.json`. |
| 6 | **Sync map path** | Where sync state is persisted. Default: `.plans/sync-map.json`. |
| 7 | **Authentication strategy** | `gh-cli` (recommended — uses `gh` CLI token), `env` (reads `GITHUB_TOKEN`), or `token` (static token in config — not recommended). |
| 8 | **Advanced options** | Optional. Validation mode (`strict` / `partial`) and max concurrent ops (1–10). Defaults are fine for most cases. |
| 9 | **Create empty plan files?** | Say yes if `.plans/*.json` don't exist yet. Creates empty arrays as stubs. |

After the wizard completes, inform the user:

> Config generated at `planpilot.json`. **Track this file in git** — it defines your sync target and plan layout, and should be shared with collaborators.

If the user prefers non-interactive setup with auto-detected defaults:

```bash
planpilot init --defaults
```

This generates a config with placeholder `board_url` that must be edited manually.

### 7) Sync Execution (sync / full)

Always dry-run first:

```bash
planpilot sync --config ./planpilot.json --dry-run
```

Review dry-run output. If everything looks correct:

```bash
planpilot sync --config ./planpilot.json --apply
```

### 8) Post-Sync Verification (sync / full)

Must verify:
- Sync command succeeded (exit code 0)
- Expected created/existing counts shown in output
- Sync map files written at expected paths
- Rerun dry-run shows no unexpected churn (idempotent)

Report to user:
- Issue URLs for created/updated items
- Count of epics/stories/tasks synced
- Any warnings or errors
- Sync map artifact paths

---

## Common Mistakes

- Stopping at analysis notes without generating `.plans/*.json` files
- **Missing `type` field** on items — every item must have `"type": "EPIC"`, `"STORY"`, or `"TASK"`
- Producing invalid hierarchy (task under epic, story without epic parent)
- Using invalid shorthand for nested fields (e.g. `"estimate": "M"` instead of `{"tshirt": "M"}`)
- Skipping dry-run before apply
- Using old/nonexistent CLI flags
- Returning pseudo-JSON with comments or trailing commas
- Creating stories that are too large (not PR-sized) or tasks that span multiple days
- Omitting `goal`, `requirements`, or `acceptance_criteria` (required by validator)
- Forgetting to set `parent_id` on stories and tasks
- Assuming `planpilot` is available without checking — always run preflight (step 5a) first
- Running `planpilot init` outside the git repo root — auto-detection of target and plan paths will fail
- Not committing `planpilot.json` to git — config must be tracked for reproducible syncs
- Writing `planpilot.json` by hand with invalid field combinations (e.g. both `unified` and `epics` in `plan_paths`)

## Completion Criteria

This skill run is complete when:
1. `.plans/epics.json`, `.plans/stories.json`, `.plans/tasks.json` are valid JSON and schema-compliant
2. All items have `type`, and hierarchy is correctly wired via `parent_id`
3. IDs are globally unique, all references resolve
4. `planpilot.json` is present and correct
5. Dry-run succeeds
6. Apply succeeds (when requested by user)
7. Sync map output exists and rerun behavior is idempotent
