# Plans Archive

This directory stores point-in-time planning and review artifacts.

- Keep active reference documentation in `docs/design/`, `docs/modules/`, and `docs/reference/`.
- Use this directory for temporary execution plans, audit logs, and post-run verification notes.
- Remove stale files periodically to keep the archive concise.
